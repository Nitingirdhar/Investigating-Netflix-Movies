# Investigating Netflix Movies

## Overview
Welcome to the Investigating Netflix Movies project! In this project, we aim to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix movies dataset to understand potential trends in movie duration over time. Your friend has raised the hypothesis that movies are getting shorter, and we'll delve into the data to investigate this claim.

## Project Structure
- `netflix_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset with information about Netflix movies. It includes columns such as Title, Release Year, Duration, etc.
- `notebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for our exploratory data analysis.
  
## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/investigating-netflix-movies.git

2. **Navigate to Repository**: Change your directory to the cloned repository:
cd investigating-netflix-movies

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Notebook**: Open and run the `investigating_netflix_movies.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the data and analyze trends in Netflix movie durations.

## Contributing
